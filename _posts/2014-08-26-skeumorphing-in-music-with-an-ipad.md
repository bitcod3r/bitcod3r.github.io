How a simple concept ’[Skeuomorphism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeuomorph "Skeuomorph in Wikipedia")’ has behind so much pragmatical meaning in virtual platforms? I this digital era when we came with so many concepts carried from the industrial age.&nbsp;

So many tools designed to be used daily to help our comfort and social needs are now so arranged in our daily life that it is challenging to detach such concepts easily. But the real truth is that our world is changing so fast that many tools overcome old fashioned tools continuously. So much that we created a bridge between them to establish a good user experience.&nbsp;

Since the creation of analog components to control our equipment, we had a real conscience about aesthetics and ergonomics. After all the digitalization process, many of those components were used in the skeuomorphism process.&nbsp;

I ask how easy that is to reconcile us to new technology when it is necessary to take advantage of new possibilities. For example, is so difficult to execute a song using a small keyboard in an iPad app.

It is different if we use a new iPad surface to control other parameters as a touchpad that brings so much more comfortable to fingers and reciprocally more feeling in the creation process.

Here is another example where we can quickly see how knobs bring us the feeling of volume control and how it helped designers expand that concept to an iPad app with limited movement feeling.

In conclusion, Skeuomorphism can help us recreate an old-fashioned world but limit our possibilities in creating new concepts.
