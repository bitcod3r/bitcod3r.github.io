The first time we consumed tweets, in a separate timeline down in early 2007, we never thought that social networks would affect our lives in a considerable way years after.&nbsp;

Now, when some organizations or groups of people conspire using Social Networks to manipulate the audience, we must be cautious about this kind of misinformation, because they can lead us to massive mistakes.

When you read something catastrophic, **first search** that information from other sources, then **find a reliable source** , then **share it**. &nbsp;_Donâ€™t be part of the viral message._
