Last week, some exciting news about&nbsp;[Nanotechnology growth in these 10 years of experiments](http://bit.ly/1sz6zuL "New nanotechnology experiments")&nbsp;in the microelectronics field pulled scientific attention.

The use of [quantum dots](http://bit.ly/1xqaKEN "The Quantum Dot: A Journey Into the Future of Microelectronics") to rate energy transfer in nanocrystals&nbsp;is the main experiment that delivers useful information to build our next generation of nano types of equipment.&nbsp; Some other experiments suggest that taking a laser to excite electrons in&nbsp;[quantum dots](http://bit.ly/1xqaKEN "The Quantum Dot: A Journey Into the Future of Microelectronics")&nbsp;could&nbsp;generate enough charge to consider this the first step to rate the amount of transferred energy.

Some&nbsp;[chemical reactions](http://bit.ly/1yhT5Va "Bioluminescence to excite quantum dots")&nbsp;could help to used to measure the energy transfer, as well as is demonstrated that bioluminescence change&nbsp;[quantum dots](http://bit.ly/1xqaKEN "The Quantum Dot: A Journey Into the Future of Microelectronics")&nbsp;state, therefore giving us a continue and natural source of light. In that step, we must consider a new experiment (e.g. using [protein R reniformis luciferase](http://bit.ly/17IC7oJ "Reniformis Luciferase")) to rate how bioluminescence&nbsp;pulses a commute transfer continuity.

In such a case, this is an excellent opportunity to think about the next generation of nanocomputers. What will be our state of the art ten years forward? Admittedly, we will take all our Computer Science theories like compilers, syntactical analysis to create new applications and make it run in nanocomputers.
